    <section name="Fixed in Apache Commons Jelly 1.0.1">
      <p>
        <strong><em>CVE-2017-12621.</em></strong> Apache Commons Jelly connects to url with certain custom doctype definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Severity:</strong> Medium
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vendor:</strong>
        The Apache Software Foundation
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Versions Affected:</strong>
        commons-jelly-1.0 (core), namely commons-jelly-1.0.jar
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong>
        During jelly (xml) file parsing with xerces, if a custom doctype entity is declared with a “SYSTEM” entity with a url and that entity is used in the body of the jelly file, during parser instantiation the parser will attempt to connect to said url. This could be a cross site scripting concern. The Open Web Application Security Project suggests that the fix be https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#XMLReader
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mitigation:</strong>
        1.0 users should migrate to 1.0.1.
      </p>
